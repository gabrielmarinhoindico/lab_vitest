# vitest
	- foco em performance ( threads running in parallel)
	- foco em teste unitÃ¡rio
	- suporta typescript e tsx
	- cypress comparation:
		- VITEST SUGGEST:
			- Cypress for all browser-based logic.
			- Vitest for all headless logic
    		- will catch issues that vitest cannot because they use real browser and real browser API's
    		- vitest simulate browser based on jsdom and jsdom don't support some API'S as window.navigation and layouts engines - as offset;
    		- don't have native support for requests, recommend install together the lib Mock Service Worker
